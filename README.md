# AI-Based Internship Recommendation Engine for PM Internship Scheme

## Problem Statement Details
- **Problem Statement ID:** 25034  
- **Problem Statement Title:** AI-Based Internship Recommendation Engine for PM Internship Scheme  
- **Organization:** Ministry of Corporate Affairs  
- **Department:** Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MoCA)  
- **Category:** Software  
- **Theme:** Smart Education  

## Background
The PM Internship Scheme receives applications from youth across India, including rural areas, tribal districts, urban slums, and remote colleges. Many candidates are first-generation learners with limited digital exposure and no prior internship experience. With hundreds of internships listed on the portal, it becomes extremely challenging for them to identify opportunities that align with their skills, interests, or aspirations.

This mismatch often leads to misaligned applications, frustration, and lost chances for valuable internships.

## Problem Description
The challenge is to develop a **lightweight AI-based recommendation engine** that can bridge this gap by providing relevant internship suggestions with minimal complexity.

The system should:  
- Deliver **3–5 personalized recommendations** instead of overwhelming users with long lists.  
- Be accessible even for **low digital literacy users**, ensuring simplicity and clarity.  
- Be **mobile-compatible** and adaptable to regional languages.  
- Integrate easily into the **existing PM Internship Scheme portal** without requiring heavy infrastructure.  

## Expected Solution
The proposed solution should include:
- **Input Capture:** Collects essential candidate inputs such as education, skills, interests, and location preferences.  
- **Recommendation Engine:** Rule-based or ML-light system matching inputs against available internships.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive UI with minimal text, icon-based navigation, and visual cues.  
- **Mobile Adaptability:** Optimized for low-end smartphones, easy accessibility for rural/remote users.  
- **Recommendation Output:** Clear and understandable results displayed as cards or short lists with actionable options.  

## 🚀 **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

## 📋 API Key Requirements

### Primary API (Optional Enhancement)
- **API Service:** Google Gemini AI
